abstract = {The four-wheeled omnidirectional platform is great to use for an indoor
mobile robot. It can increasingly move and change heading directions.
However, the robot is easy to slip when it is moving. One or more wheels
are sometimes not touching the ground. This paper approaches to solving
these problems by computational simulation in locomotion. The
mathematical models simulate the robot movement. The robot struggles to
go to the target with randomly simulated slips and untouched ground
circumstances. The robot can estimate the positions using the Kalman
filter and readjust itself to the planned path. Consequently, this paper
demonstrates the motion improvement and compares the results of
decreasing errors.},

A nonlinear slip model is incorporated into the dynamics of the system and the resulting equations of motion are derived using a Euler-Lagrange formulation. These are additionally transformed into slip-space, where the dynamical equations lend themselves to a convenient analysis of the slip dynamics. The conventional assumptions for ideal rolling are also explored and a reduced expression for the nonlinear dynamics is generated for such situations. Preliminary explorations toward a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics for omniwheel platforms under various control schemes is also initiated. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

@article{Ryu2011,
abstract = {Slip between the ground and wheel often cannot be avoided in most applications of mobile robots. However, a majority of controllers developed so far make a no-slip assumption with non-holonomic constraints. To achieve desired performance in the presence of slip, controllers that are robust to slip are required. In this paper, we discuss robust trajectory-tracking control for a differentially driven two-wheeled mobile robot. The structure of a differential flatness controller, which has shown distinctive advantages providing an integrated framework for planning and control, is extended to account for slip disturbances. It is shown that the differential flatness framework can be extended to develop a robust controller based on a dynamic as well as a kinematic model with slip. Simulation results for both kinematic and dynamic controllers are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust controllers. Experiments with the kinematic controller which is suited to typical laboratory and field mobile robots were conducted to validate the proposed robust controller. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed robust controllers are effective in the presence of slip. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

@article{Gracia2007,
abstract = {This work presents a kinematic modeling method for wheeled mobile robots with slip based on physical principles. First, we present the kinematic modeling of a mobile robot with no-slip considering four types of wheels: fixed, centered orientable, off-centered orientable (castor) and Swedish (also called Mecanum, Ilon or universal). Then, the dynamics of a wheeled mobile robot based on Lagrange formulation are derived and discussed. Next, a quasi-static motion is considered to obtain the kinematic conditions that provide the slip modeling equations. Several types of traction models for the slip between the wheel and the floor are indicated. In particular, for a frictional force linearly dependent on the sliding velocity, the no-slip kinematic equation of the wheeled mobile robot is related, through the weighted least-squares algorithm, with the slip modeling equations. To illustrate the applications of the proposed approach a tricycle vehicle is considered in a real situation. The experimental results obtained for the slip kinematic model are compared with the ones obtained for the well-known Kalman filter. {\textcopyright} 2007 VSP.},

@article{Balakrishna1995,
abstract = {Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) are known to be nonholonomic systems, and most dynamic models of WMRs assume that the wheels undergo rolling without slipping. This paper deals with the problem of modeling and simulation of motion of a WMR when the conditions for rolling are not satisfied at the wheels. We use a traction model where the adhesion coefficient between the wheels of a WMR and a hard flat surface is a function of the wheel slip. This traction model is used in conjunction with the dynamic equations of motion to simulate the motion of the WMR. The simulations show that controllers which do not take into account wheel slip give poor tracking performance for the WMR and path deviation is small only for large adhesion coefficients. This work shows the importance of wheel slip and suggests use of accurate traction models for improving tracking performance of a WMR. {\textcopyright} 1995 IEEE},

@article{Muir1987,
abstract = {We formulate the kinematic equations of motion of wheeled mobile robots incorporating conventional, omnidirectional, and ball wheels.1 We extend the kinematic modeling of stationary manipulators to accommodate such special characteristics of wheeled mobile robots as multiple closed‐link chains, higher‐pair contact points between a wheel and a surface, and unactuated and unsensed wheel degrees of freedom. We apply the Sheth‐Uicker convention to assign coordinate axes and develop a matrix coordinate transformation algebra to derive the equations of motion. We introduce a wheel Jacobian matrix to relate the motions of each wheel to the motions of the robot. We then combine the individual wheel equations to obtain the composite robot equation of motion. We interpret the properties of the composite robot equation to characterize the mobility of a wheeled mobile robot according to a mobility characterization tree. Similarly, we apply actuation and sensing characterization trees to delineate the robot motions producible by the wheel actuators and discernible by the wheel sensors, respectively. We calculate the sensed forward and actuated inverse solutions and interpret the physical conditions which guarantee their existence. To illustrate the development, we formulate and interpret the kinematic equations of motion of Uranus, a wheeled mobile robot being constructed in the CMU Mobile Robot Laboratory.

@article{Alexander1989,
abstract = {A wheeled mobile robot is here modelled as a planar rigid body that rides on an arbitrary number of wheels. The rela tionship between the rigid body motion of the robot and the steering and drive rates of wheels is developed. In particular, conditions are obtained that guarantee that rolling without skidding or sliding can occur. Explicit differential equations are derived to describe the rigid body motions that arise in such ideal rolling trajectories. The simplest wheel configura tion that permits access of arbitrary rigid-body motions is determined. Then the question of slippage due to misalign ment of the wheels is investigated by minimization of a non- smooth convex dissipation functional that is derived from Coulomb's Law offriction. It is shown that this minimization principle is equivalent to the construction of quasi-static motions. Examples are presented to illustrate the models. {\textcopyright} 1989, Sage Publications.
