abstract = {The increasing pace of economic development and urbanization around the world has led to serious problems of environmental pollution, particularly from automobile emissions which contributes to Global Warming. In this paper, a low-cost mobile urban environmental monitoring system is proposed using off-the-shelf open source hardware and software. The system can be installed or used in public transport vehicles, particularly in school and college buses in countries like India. A pollution map of local and regional environments can be built from the data acquired, and displayed online leading to increased awareness of urban pollution problems. The system can also be used in situ in school and college buses to educate children and youth on emerging technologies like computer hardware, software, and web technologies. Results of prototype implementation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Aircraft measurements are used to characterize properties of clear-air turbulence in the lower Arctic troposphere. For typical vertical resolutions in general circulation models, there is evidence for both downgradient and countergradient vertical turbulent transport of momentum and heat in the mostly statically stable conditions within both the boundary layer and the free troposphere. Countergradient transport is enhanced in the free troposphere compared to the boundary layer. Three parametrizations are suggested to formulate the turbulent heat flux and are evaluated using the observations. The parametrization that accounts for the anisotropic nature of turbulence and buoyancy flux predicts both observed downgradient and countergradient transport of heat more accurately than those that do not. The inverse turbulent Prandtl number is found to only weakly decrease with increasing gradient Richardson number in a statistically significant way, but with large scatter in the data. The suggested parametrizations can potentially improve the performance of regional and global atmospheric models.},

The method was validated with data from grid-generated, free-shear-layer, and wall-bounded turbulence. Length scales were calculated in turbulent boundary layers with momentum thickness Reynolds numbers from 400 to 2100 and in flows with turbulent Reynolds numbers as low as 90.},

Through this new paradigm, physical phenomena can be observed in a distributed way, crowd-sourcing the data measurement tasks to smartphones and/or other popular smart wearables. Mobile sensing and wireless communications can hence be employed to gather data and generate new information and services, benefiting our society. As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a mobile sensing platform able to pervasively collect environmental data. To improve the quality of collected data we have also created an application for pedestrian navigation that works both on smartphones (also using Augmented Reality) and on smartwatches, thus ensuring an appropriate exposition of the mobile device (and its sensors) when collecting data. Furthermore, our navigation app is able to provide users with personalized pedestrian routes that take into account environmental parameters and not only the route length. Finally, we have also devised a web service able to provide graphical visualization and historical evolution of sensed data.},

abstract = {Measurements of carbon dioxide concentration become a very popular method for determination of the air exchange rate in buildings. In measurement practice applied by many researches only one sensor is used in a single room. This cause that the measured CO2 concentration should represent mean concentration in the room. This cause that the positioning of the CO2 sensors is crucial for such a measurements. This paper attempts to find representative measuring area of mean CO2 concentration in a particular room with one sleeping person using numerical modelling. Different parameters that determineCO2 distribution in the room were analysed. Results show that the geometry of the window opening and internal heat sources have a significant influence on a spatial distribution of CO2. It was found that simplified exhalation compared to a full breathing model of the person is enough precise for accurate CO2 distribution analyses. Representative area of CO2 concentration spreads over the half of the room. CO2 sensors can be positioned in the centre of the room or moved towards the door were the air flows out. Positions which should be avoided during the measurements were in the vicinity of the radiator and window. In case of the sleeping person all the space over the sleeping person must be excluded from the measurements. The distance of the sensor from the wall should be at least 40cm. The measurements can be successfully made in the centre of the room independently of the room height. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Specifically, a point in three dimensions is considered that is commanded to move in a straight line, but whose actual motion may differ from the commanded motion, possibly involving sliding against obstacles. Given that the point initially lies in some start region, the problem of finding a sequence of commanded velocities that is guaranteed to move the point to the goal is shown to be nondeterministic exponential-time hard, thus making it a provably intractable problem.},

abstract = {Prevention of indoor contaminant source leak disasters is becoming an urgent issue in the indoor environment and public safety fields. Quickly locating such a source is a prerequisite for effective implementation of source control, and a key basis for further guidance on evacuation and emergency rescue. Indoor contaminant sources have many forms because of source characteristic variation. The current research focuses on continuous release from a source with constant intensity and instantaneous release from a source with impulse intensity. There are few studies of sources with varying release intensity. The main goal of the present research study was to develop a source localization method for a time-varying source. A computational fluid dynamics model of leakage for an indoor time-varying contaminant source is established, together with a search strategy using multi-robot active olfaction. Based on the time-varying leakage source localization method, the robots are used to verify method effectiveness through indoor two-dimensional ventilation room simulation experiments. The influence of factors such as intensity change, position and obstacles on the localization is analyzed, which provides a foundation for further study of contaminant source identification in an unsteady flow field.},

This hybrid system combines a novel obstacle representation scheme, the concept of evolutionary searching and a new concept that we refer to as 'visibility-based repair' to form a hybrid which quickly transforms infeasible motions into feasible ones. Our hybrid evolutionary system differs from other evolutionary motion planners in that (1) more emphasis is placed on repairing infeasible motions to develop feasible ones rather than using simulated evolution exclusively as a means of discovering feasible motions, (2) a continuous map of the environment is used rather than a discretized map, and (3) it develops motion plans for moving or mobile destinations. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new hybrid by using two challenging motion planning problems where the target tries to move away from our point robot.},

abstract = {Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is a critical aspect of the built environment to ensure occupant health, comfort, well-being and productivity. Existing IEQ monitoring approaches rely on sensor networks deployed at selected locations to collect environmental measurements, and are limited in scale and adaptability due to infrastructure cost and maintenance requirement. To enable high-granularity IEQ monitoring with agile adaption to the dynamic indoor environment, we propose an “automated mobile sensing” system that dispatches a sensor-rich navigation-capable robot to actively survey the indoor space. Data collected in this fashion is sparse in the joint temporal and spatial domain, and cannot be used directly for IEQ evaluation. To deal with this special characteristics, we developed a spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm to capture the global trend and local variation in order to use the data efficiently to reconstruct the IEQ dynamics. We compared the performance of the automated mobile sensing with a dense sensor network in a laboratory where we measured the air-change effectiveness (ASHRAE standard 129) for four different conditions. Results indicate that automated mobile sensing is able to accurately estimate the parameters with a minimal sensor cost and calibration effort. Potential applications of this system include indoor thermal comfort, lighting, indoor air quality and acoustic monitoring, pollutant source identification, and building commissioning. We shared publicly the source codes for robot control, sensor setup, and interpolation algorithm to encourage comparison study and further development.},

During a single investigation of one day (from 9:00 to 18:00), outdoor air temperature, air humidity, global temperature and wind speed were continuously measured at one measuring point. People visiting the public spaces (near the measuring site) were randomly invited to fill out a questionnaire describing their feelings of thermal comfort and other important psychological factors. Based on the field data (7851 samples), relationship between people's outdoor thermal sensation and the microclimate parameters were quantified. Further, the effect of the microclimate parameters on outdoor thermal sensation and neutral temperatures was analyzed. The results revealed that outdoor microclimate parameters, especially outdoor air temperature, play important roles on outdoor thermal sensation when people stay outdoors. The variation in outdoor microclimate parameters led to the biggest change of outdoor neutral temperature in winter. Seasonal and regional differences in outdoor neutral temperature were found, which reflects different thermal comfort requirements under distinct outdoor microclimate conditions.},

abstract = {The multi-zone model is widely used to predict airflow and contaminant transport in large buildings under natural or mechanical ventilation. Selecting appropriate mixing factors and particle deposition velocities for the multi-zone model can compensate for the errors resulting from the model's well-mixing assumption. However, different room types, air change rates and ventilation modes can result in different mixing factors and particle deposition velocities. This study selected three typical room types: Z-type, L-type, and rectangle type (R-type). For each room type, the mixing factors and particle deposition velocities were investigated by the CFD model under different natural ventilation rates (0.5 h−1, 1 h−1, 3 h−1, 6 h−1, 12 h−1 and 20 h−1) and modes (door-inlet, window-inlet). The results showed that the mixing factor of the Z-type room was the highest, and the mixing factors of these rooms were 1.32, 1.28 and 1.13, respectively. In addition, the mixing factors presented a V-shaped distribution as a function of the air exchange rate under the window-inlet mode. The particle deposition velocity increased as the air change rate increased, and also demonstrated that the V-shaped curves as a function of particle size (0.05 $\mu$m, 0.1 $\mu$m, 0.5 $\mu$m, 1 $\mu$m, 2.5 $\mu$m, 5 $\mu$m) varied under different air change rates and room types. The results of mixing factors and particle deposition velocities for different room types, air change rates and ventilation modes can be used to improve the accuracy of the multi-zone model.},

abstract = {This paper Presents algorithms for computing constraints on the position of an object due to the presence of other objects. This problem arises in applications that require choosing how to arrange or how to move objects without collisions. The approach presented here is based on characterizing the position and orientation of an object as a single point in a configuration space, in which each coordinate represents a degree of freedom in the position or orientation of the object. The configurations forbidden to this object, due to the presence of other objects, can then be characterized as regions in the configuration space, called configuration space obstacles. The paper presents algorithms for computing these configuration space obstacles when the objects are polygons or polyhedra.

abstract = {Various errors and influences leading to differences between lower- and aircraft-measured fluxes are surveyed. This survey is motivated by reports in the literature that aircraft fluxes are sometimes smaller than tower-measured fluxes. Both tower and aircraft flux errors are larger with surface heterogeneity due to several independent effects. Surface heterogeneity may cause tower flux errors to increase with decreasing wind speed. Techniques to assess flux sampling errors are reviewed. Such error estimates suffer various degrees of in-applicability in real geophysical time series due to nonstationarity of tower time series (or inhomogeneity of aircraft data). A new measure for nonstationarity is developed that eliminates assumptions on the form of the nonstationarity inherent in previous methods. When this nonstationarity measure becomes large, the surface energy imbalance increases sharply. Finally, strategies for obtaining adequate flux sampling using repeated aircraft passes and grid patterns are outlined.},

abstract = {This paper describes an architecture for estimating environmental odor maps and presents experimental results obtained using that architecture with five mobile robots inside a large laboratory with two odor sources and forced ventilation. The mobile sensing agents employed in the experiments have self localization capabilities and carry an electronic nose and a thermal anemometer. The proposed architecture allows integrating sparse olfaction data gathered by the mobile agents along their trajectories and dynamically estimate the spatial concentration of different odor fields. The data assimilation process is made centrally by a PC that polls periodically each robot through a RF network in order to get the data gathered during the previous acquisition period. The estimation of odor fields is made in two steps: first each agent estimates the odor mixture and concentration by means of a neural network-based regression algorithm that converts values from gas sensor space to the corresponding odor space. Then the sensed data is assimilated into an advection-diffusion model by means of a reduced order Kalman filter. In the current implementation the central controller, responsible for the maps estimation, specifies to each agent their target area to explore. The proposed architecture was validated with a set of experiments that demonstrated its ability to estimate and capture the dynamics of overlapping odor fields. This work can easily be adapted to city buses or other local transportation systems in order to monitor the pollution or quickly detect hazardous chemicals inside cities. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {We report highly resolved temperature measurements in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection in air at a fixed Prandtl number Pr = 0.7. Extending our previous work (du Puits et al 2007 J. Fluid Mech. 572 231-54), we carried out measurements at various aspect ratios while keeping the Rayleigh number constant. We demonstrate that the temperature field inside the convective boundary layers of both horizontal plates is virtually independent on the global flow pattern accompanying the variation in the aspect ratio. Thanks to technical upgrades of the experimental facility as well as a significant improvement of the accuracy and reliability of our temperature measurement - and unlike in our previous work - we find that the measured profiles of the time-averaged temperature field neither follow a clear power-law trend nor fit a linear or a logarithmic scaling over a significant fraction of the boundary-layer thickness. Analyzing the temperature data simultaneously acquired at both horizontal plates, various transitions in the cross-correlation and the auto-correlation function of the temperature signals are observed while varying the aspect ratio $\Gamma$. These transitions might be associated with a change in the global flow pattern from a single-roll mode at $\Gamma$ = 1 toward a double- or a multi-roll mode pattern at higher aspect ratios. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

This paper presents a novel approach of path planning. First the MAKLINK graph is built to describe the working space of the mobile robot; then the Dijkstra algorithm is used to obtain the shortest path from the start point to the goal point in the graph, finally the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to get the optimal path. Aiming at the shortcoming of the PSO algorithm, that is, easily plunging into the local minimum, this paper puts forward an advanced PSO algorithm with the mutation operator. By adding a mutation operator to the algorithm, it can not only escape the attraction of the local minimum in the later convergence phase, but also maintain the characteristic of fast speed in the early phase. The results of the simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can meet the real-time requests of the mobile robot's navigation.},

abstract = {The capabilities and distributed nature of networked sensors are uniquely suited to the characterization of distributed phenomena in the natural environment. However, environmental characterization by fixed distributed sensors encounters challenges in complex environments. In this paper we describe Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS), a new distributed, robotic sensor methodology developed for applications including characterization of environmental structure and phenomena. NIMS exploits deployed infrastructure that provides the benefits of precise motion, aerial suspension, and low energy sustainable operations in complex environments. NIMS nodes may explore a three-dimensional environment and enable the deployment of sensor nodes at diverse locations and viewing perspectives. NIMS characterization of phenomena in a three dimensional space must now consider the selection of sensor sampling points in both time and space. Thus, we introduce a new approach of mobile node adaptive sampling with the objective of minimizing error between the actual and reconstructed spatiotemporal behavior of environmental variables while minimizing required motion. In this approach, the NIMS node first explores as an agent, gathering a statistical description of phenomena using a nested stratified random sampling approach. By iteratively increasing sampling resolution, guided adaptively by the measurement results themselves, this NIMS sampling enables reconstruction of phenomena with a systematic method for balancing accuracy with sampling resource cost in time and motion. This adaptive sampling method is described analytically and also tested with simulated environmental data. Experimental evaluations of adaptive sampling algorithms have also been completed. Specifically, NIMS experimental systems have been developed for monitoring of spatiotemporal variation of atmospheric climate phenomena. A NIMS system has been deployed at a field biology station to map phenomena in a 50m width and 50m span transect in a forest environment. In addition, deployments have occurred in testbed environments allowing additional detailed characterization of sampling algorithms. Environmental variable mapping of temperature, humidity, and solar illumination have been acquired and used to evaluate the adaptive sampling methods reported here. These new methods have been shown to provide a significant advance for efficient mapping of spatially distributed phenomena by NIMS environmental robotics.},

abstract = {In a warm and humid climate, increasing the temperature set point offers considerable energy benefits with low first costs. Elevated air movement generated by a personally controlled fan can compensate for the negative effects caused by an increased temperature set point. Fifty-six tropically acclimatized persons in common Singaporean office attire (0.7 clo) were exposed for 90 minutes to each of five conditions: 23, 26, and 29°C and in the latter two cases with and without occupant-controlled air movement. Relative humidity was maintained at 60{\%}. We tested thermal comfort, perceived air quality, sick building syndrome symptoms, and cognitive performance. We found that thermal comfort, perceived air quality, and sick building syndrome symptoms are equal or better at 26°C and 29°C than at the common set point of 23°C if a personally controlled fan is available for use. The best cognitive performance (as indicated by task speed) was obtained at 26°C; at 29°C, the availability of an occupant-controlled fan partially mitigated the negative effect of the elevated temperature. The typical Singaporean indoor air temperature set point of 23°C yielded the lowest cognitive performance. An elevated set point in air-conditioned buildings augmented with personally controlled fans might yield benefits for reduced energy use and improved indoor environmental quality in tropical climates.},

Mobile robots range from the Mars Pathfinder mission's teleoperated Sojourner to the cleaning robots in the Paris Metro. This text offers students and other interested readers an introduction to the fundamentals of mobile robotics, spanning the mechanical, motor, sensory, perceptual, and cognitive layers the field comprises. The text focuses on mobility itself, offering an overview of the mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real world environment to perform its tasks, including locomotion, sensing, localization, and motion planning. It synthesizes material from such fields as kinematics, control theory, signal analysis, computer vision, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. The book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter treats a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. It covers all aspects of mobile robotics, including software and hardware design considerations, related technologies, and algorithmic techniques. This second edition has been revised and updated throughout, with 130 pages of new material on such topics as locomotion, perception, localization, and planning and navigation. Problem sets have been added at the end of each chapter. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook or a working tool for beginning practitioners.

Exposure to pollutants in the sleep environment often leads to a variety of adverse health effects, such as development and exacerbation of asthma. Avoiding exposure to these pollutants by providing a sufficient air quality in the sleep environment might be a feasible method to alleviate these health symptoms. We performed full-scale laboratory measurements using a thermal manikin positioned on an experimental bed. Three ventilation settings were tested: with no filtration system operated, use of portable air cleaner and use of a temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) device. The first part of the experiment investigated the air-flow characteristics in the breathing zone. In the second part, particle removal efficiency was estimated. Measured in the breathing zone, the room air cleaner demonstrated high turbulence intensity, high velocity and turbulence diffusivity level, with a particle reduction rate of 52{\%} compared to baseline after 30 minutes. The TLA device delivered a laminar airflow to the breathing zone with a reduction rate of 99.5{\%}. During a periodical duvet lifting mimicking a subject's movement in bed, the particle concentration was significantly lower with the TLA device compared to the room air cleaner. The TLA device provided a barrier which significantly reduced the introduction of airborne particles into the breathing zone. Further studies should be conducted for the understanding of the transport of resuspended particles between the duvet and the laying body.},

abstract = {We investigate the spatial characteristics of urban-like canopy flow by applying particle image velocimetry (PIV) to atmospheric turbulence. The study site was a Comprehensive Outdoor Scale MOdel (COSMO) experiment for urban climate in Japan. The PIV system captured the two-dimensional flow field within the canopy layer continuously for an hour with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz, thereby providing reliable outdoor turbulence statistics. PIV measurements in a wind-tunnel facility using similar roughness geometry, but with a lower sampling frequency of 4 Hz, were also done for comparison. The turbulent momentum flux from COSMO, and the wind tunnel showed similar values and distributions when scaled using friction velocity. Some different characteristics between outdoor and indoor flow fields were mainly caused by the larger fluctuations in wind direction for the atmospheric turbulence. The focus of the analysis is on a variety of instantaneous turbulent flow structures. One remarkable flow structure is termed 'flushing', that is, a large-scale upward motion prevailing across the whole vertical cross-section of a building gap. This is observed intermittently, whereby tracer particles are flushed vertically out from the canopy layer. Flushing phenomena are also observed in the wind tunnel where there is neither thermal stratification nor outer-layer turbulence. It is suggested that flushing phenomena are correlated with the passing of large-scale low-momentum regions above the canopy.},

abstract = {Building energy simulations are mostly implemented using network or multi-zone models that do not consider indoor air temperature and velocity distribution. However, the recent introduction of personal ventilation, floor-heating systems, and displacement ventilation positively utilizes a nonuniform indoor environment to meet the demand for both energy efficiency and thermal comfort. Therefore, it is expected that building energy simulation results will be significantly impacted by the choice of an appropriate reference air temperature for the calculation of heat transfer through constructed materials. This means that the air temperature distribution needs to be taken into account for nonuniform environments when carrying out energy simulations. An alternative approach to this problem is to combine a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation directly with a network model; however, this approach is unfortunately too computationally time-consuming. In this study, we propose an acceptably fast simulation method that couples the contribution ratio of indoor climate (CRI), which is extracted from CFD results and indicates the individual impact of all heat factors, with the network model to implement an energy simulation that incorporates a temperature distribution. With the introduction of CRI, it is possible to achieve a precision as high as that of CFD and a calculation speed as fast as that of the network model. A case study simulating the thermal load of a single office room was carried out with the CRI-coupled method. The energy demand result calculated by CRI-coupled method was 15-20{\%} lower than that of a non-coupled network simulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
