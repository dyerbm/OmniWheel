abstract = {The dynamics of a vehicle whose three omniwheels are symmetrically arranged is considered in the case when the vehicle moves on a horizontal plane. Two wheels are parallel to each other, whereas the third one is perpendicular to them; the centers of the wheels are located at the vertices of an isosceles triangle. A phase portrait is constructed under the assumption that there are no external actions (except for gravity). The stability conditions for uniform rectilinear motions are compared with the Chaplygin sleigh model. The stability and bifurcation of steady motions are discussed in the case of constant control. {\textcopyright} Allerton Press, Inc., 2008.},

abstract = {Four-wheel Mecanum mobile robots (FWMRs) are widely used in transportation because of their omnidirectional mobility. However, the FWMR trades off energy efficiency for flexibility. To efficiently predict the energy consumption of the robot movement processes, this paper proposes a power consumption model for the omnidirectional movement of an FWMR. A power consumption model is of great significance for reducing the power consumption, motion control, and path planning of robots. However, FWMRs are highly maneuverable, meaning their control is complicated and their energy modeling is extremely complex. The speed, distance, path, and power consumption of the robot can vary greatly depending on the control method. This energy model was mathematically implemented in MATLAB and validated by our laboratory's Mecanum wheel robot. The prediction accuracy of the model was over 95{\%} through simulation and experimental verification.},

abstract = {Due to the superior mobility and maneuverability to move toward any position and attain any orientation simultaneously, Mecanum-wheels omnidirectional mobile robot (MWOMR) is playing a significant role in autonomous transportation and service. This paper proposes a robust nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control scheme for the path-following problem of an MWOMR. First, a plant model is identified as a second-order state-space equation with four inputs and three outputs to describe the MWOMR's path-tracking kinematics and dynamics. Afterwards, a multi–input–multi–output NTSM controller is designed for the MWOMR, and the stability of the NTSM control system is verified by means of Lyapunov function. In addition, the setting guideline of control parameters is elaborated in detail, and a Runge–Kutta formula-based dead-reckoning algorithm is employed to calculate the position and yaw angle information of the robot in real time. Lastly, experiments are carried out to test the control performance in the scenarios of lateral movement and circular movement with initial offset. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented NTSM control strategy owns evident superiority in terms of higher tracking accuracy and stronger robustness against different movements in comparison with a conventional sliding mode (CSM) controller.},

The conventional assumptions for ideal rolling are also explored and a reduced expression for the nonlinear dynamics is generated for such situations. Preliminary explorations toward a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics for omniwheel platforms under various control schemes is also initiated. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper shows how to control a robot with omnidirectional wheels, using as example robots with four motors, and generalizing to n motors. More than three wheels provide redundancy: many combinations of motors speeds can provide the same Euclidean movement. Since the system is over-determined, we show how to compute a set of consistent and optimal motor forces and speeds using the pseudoinverse of coupling matrices. This approach allows us also to perform a consistency check to determine whether a wheel is slipping on the floor or not. We show that it is possible to avoid wheel slippage by driving the robot with a motor torque under a certain threshold or handle it and make high accelerations possible.},

@article{Liu2007,
abstract = {In this paper, an integrated navigation and control for omni-directional mobile robot is developed. Both control and navigation algorithms are based on trajectory linearization. The robot control is based on trajectory linearization control (TLC), in which an open-loop kinematic inversion and a closed-loop linear time varying (LTV) stabilizer are combined together to provide robust and accurate trajectory tracking performance. The LTV stabilizer is designed along the nominal trajectory provided by the kinematic inversion. The robot navigation is based on a sensor fusion using nonlinear Kalman filter which is also designed along the nominal trajectory. The sensor fusion combines onboard sensor and vision system measurements together, and provides reliable and accurate location and orientation measurements. Gating technology is employed to remove the inaccurate vision measurement. A real-time hardware-in-theloop (HIL) simulation system was built to verified the proposed integrated control and navigation. Test results show that the proposed method improves robot location and orientation measurements reliability and accuracy, thus it improves the robot controller performance significantly. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Available control models in literature for Mecanum-wheeled mobile robots are based on a simplification which defines the contact point of the wheel on the ground as the point in the center of the wheel, which does not vary. This limits the smoothness of motion of a mobile robot employing these wheels and impacts the efficiency of locomotion of mobile robots using Mecanum wheels. The control model proposed in this paper accounts for the fact that the contact point in fact changes position down the axle of the wheel as the angle roller moves on the ground. The developed control model is verified with experimental results. Using the refined model, control of Mecanum-wheeled mobile robot is made more predictable and accurate. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

A lot of research has been done using three universal wheels but trajectory control for four Mecanum wheeled mobile robot (FMWMR) in presence of uncertainties still needs attention. Thus, to obtain smooth motion of mobile robots, with chattering free control input, in presence of uncertainties and external force disturbances, a robust and adaptive control is necessary. In view of these aspects, this paper extends the use of adaptive sliding mode controller for trajectory tracking of FMWMR. The effectiveness of proposed controller is verified using two case problems. Simulation results are presented for the verification of proposed controller for FMWMR. Further, experiments are conducted using position and orientation sensor to show the performance of the controller in real world environment. Simulation and experimental results revealed that FMWMR is capable of tracking any type of trajectories.},
