Collaborative mobile crowdsensing enables information to be gathered and shared by users who are directly involved (participatory sensing) or integrated seamlessly as needed (opportunistic sensing) through user mobile platforms. To address the scalability needs of the mobile ecosystem, we additionally employ compressive sensing techniques for approximate gathering and processing of sensor data - this requires new mechanisms for sensor data collection, tunable approximate processing, and mobile networking architecture, to create a compressive collaborative mobile crowdsensing platform called SenseDroid. The proposed framework is build using a multi-tired hierarchical architecture to sense spatial variations of a parameter of interest, perceive spatio-temporal fields, and enable energy efficient local mobile sensing with a small number of measurements. This approximate, yet tunable approach combines different sensing approaches opportunistically while trading scalability (and coverage) for data accuracy (and energy efficiency). In this paper we propose and discuss the framework and the challenges associated with compressive and collaborative mobile sensing for multi-tired hierarchical mobile network architecture for emerging mobile collaborative applications.

The cooperative and active controller is designed via the real-time feedback of the sensing performance to steer the mobile sensors to new locations in order to improve the sensing quality. During the movement of the mobile sensors, the measurements from each sensor node and its neighbors are fused with the corresponding confidences using distributed consensus filters.

Accurate and rapid identification of outdoor pollutant sources can facilitate proper and effective air quality management in urban environments. Traditional “trial–error” process is time consuming and is incapacity in distinguishing multiple potential sources, which is common in urban pollution. Inverse prediction methods such as probability based adjoint modelling method have shown viability for locating indoor contaminant sources. This paper advances the adjoint probability method to track outdoor pollutant sources of constant release. The study develops an inverse modelling algorithm that can promptly locate multiple outdoor pollutant sources with limited pollution information detected by a movable sensor. Two numerical field experiments are conducted to illustrate and verify the predictions: one in an open space and the other in an urban environment. The developed algorithm promptly and accurately identifies the source locations in both cases. The requirement of an accurate urban building model is the primary prerequisite of the developed algorithm for urban application.},

abstract = {This paper describes an architecture for estimating environmental odor maps and presents experimental results obtained using that architecture with five mobile robots inside a large laboratory with two odor sources and forced ventilation. The mobile sensing agents employed in the experiments have self localization capabilities and carry an electronic nose and a thermal anemometer. The proposed architecture allows integrating sparse olfaction data gathered by the mobile agents along their trajectories and dynamically estimate the spatial concentration of different odor fields. The data assimilation process is made centrally by a PC that polls periodically each robot through a RF network in order to get the data gathered during the previous acquisition period. The estimation of odor fields is made in two steps: first each agent estimates the odor mixture and concentration by means of a neural network-based regression algorithm that converts values from gas sensor space to the corresponding odor space. Then the sensed data is assimilated into an advection-diffusion model by means of a reduced order Kalman filter. In the current implementation the central controller, responsible for the maps estimation, specifies to each agent their target area to explore. The proposed architecture was validated with a set of experiments that demonstrated its ability to estimate and capture the dynamics of overlapping odor fields. This work can easily be adapted to city buses or other local transportation systems in order to monitor the pollution or quickly detect hazardous chemicals inside cities. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

In the proposed method, the robot carries out the D-S inference and iteratively updates a grid map in which each cell has two states (i.e., occupied by an odor source, and not occupied by odor source), using the successive measurements from a gas sensor and an anemometer when the robot follows the dynamic-planned searching route in the given work area. The searching route is planned online to maximize the decline of the uncertainties of the grid cells around the robot. The mapping of the odor sources and the planning of the searching route work side-by-side. Simulations are carried out and the results in a time-varying airflow environment show that the locations of the two odor sources can be estimated online with the D-S inference, and the time cost can be greatly reduced by following the dynamic-planned searching route compared with by following a predefined path shaped like rectangular wave to cover the given searching area.},

Particularly, in a bridge like the Seto-Ohashi, it takes a long time to inspect the whole and it is also dangerous because of high-place work. Then, use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be considered as one of the alternative ways to the human visual-check. Among them, Quadrotors are attracting attention and they have excellent maneuverability and operability because they control the position and attitude of the airframe by changing the revolution velocity of four rotors. However, since a thrust cannot be generated except for upward direction, there is a weak point in which it is out of control, if it is affected by the influence of an ascending current etc. when hovering. In particular, vortices are generated around huge structures represented by bridges, so that it is difficult to inspect without considering this effect. In this research, it is aimed at developing a Quadrotor that can check infrastructures in harsh environments by attaching auxiliary thrusters and an anemometer. This paper first outlines a proposed Quadrotor. In addition, it verifies the accuracy of our own built-in anemometer. Finally, the effect of the airframe on the anemometer is verified through some experiments. The experimental results showed that the manufactured anemometer needs to be redesigned.},

abstract = {In underwater sensor networks, localization is one of the most important issues because sensor nodes are considerably difficult to be deployed at determined locations. Localization schemes using a mobile beacon have fine-grained localization accuracy because one mobile beacon can replace a lot of static beacons. In localization with a mobile beacon, the movement of a mobile beacon determines the deployment of the beacons used for localization and the deployment influences the localization accuracy. To improve the localization accuracy for localization with a mobile beacon, the study on the path of a mobile beacon is necessary. In this paper, we propose a static path to improve the localization accuracy by considering the path of a mobile beacon and the deployment of the beacons. Simulation results show that the determined static path provides higher localization accuracy than a random path and other static paths. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},
